# Granblue Fantasy Battle ID Copy

**As of Nov. 15, 2024, this extension has been rendered obsolete due to a copy button now existing in-game.**

This extension for Chrome provides a button to copy the ID of a multibattle to clipboard. Inspired by the [battle.js script created by ckx000](https://github.com/ckx000/GBF).

## Installation

Download a [ZIP of this repo](https://github.com/menma1234/gbf-battlecopy/archive/master.zip), unzip it, hit "Load unpacked extension...", and find the directory you unzipped it to. I'm not providing a packed version of this.

Unlike my other extensions, this does not need developer tools.

## Future

Stuff I plan to do if I'm not lazy:
* Auto-copy ID to clipboard on battle start
* Customize what's included in the text that's copied to clipboard (e.g. number of participants, enemy name, etc.)
